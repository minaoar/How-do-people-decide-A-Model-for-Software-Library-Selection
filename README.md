6. After the interviews were performed, we prepared a summary of our findings and shared with the interview participants to collect their feedback. The following file has the questions we asked and the responses we received from the participants:
- "06. EVALUATION-Member-check-response.pdf"
7. Finally, we finished the draft of our study paper, we evaluated the study using the Grounded Theory study assessment criteria provided by Corbin and Strauss (2014). The following file contains all the questions for the 17 criteria and our response to those criteria.
